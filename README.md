> [!IMPORTANT]
> It was decided to **split the client and server** into two repositories. This repository is the **server** repository.
The repository for the **client** is located at the link: [**client**](https://github.com/StickyDice/Midas)

> [!NOTE]
> To launch the application use a `docker compose up` for Ubuntu and `docker-compose up` for Windows. You can specify the way to start your server using `-d` tag. The one starts server in a background, so if you need to stop server runs in the background use `docker compose down` for Ubuntu and `docker-compose down` for Windows.
